# hi, i'm noah!
i'm a software engineer on the web platform team at [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb)

before that i spent six and a half years at [Meta](https://github.com/facebook) working on React and web infrastructure

in between, i attended a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)


## open source highlights
- **[React](https://github.com/facebook/react)** · former core team member. most of my work was internal to Meta — coordinating a company-wide deprecation of legacy APIs across thousands of callsites and helping unblock open-source React development. in the open-source repo:
  - integrated experimental scheduling primitives ([`scheduler.yield`](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/27069), [`postTask`](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/27295), [`isInputPending`](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28444)) into React's scheduler
  - [cleaned up](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28509) [feature](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/27011) [flags](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/27056) and deprecated APIs, modernized [test](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28161) [infrastructure](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/28223)
  - ran experiments on facebook.com around [Activity](https://react.dev/reference/react/Activity) that contributed to it shipping
  - supported the [React 19](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pulls?q=reviewed-by%3Anoahlemen) release through code reviews, docs, and blog post reviews
- **[flow-api-translator](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/tree/main/tools/hermes-parser/js/flow-api-translator)** · took this from prototype to production ([my commits](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Afacebook%2Fhermes+%22noahlemen%40meta.com%22&type=commits)) — translates Flow source into `.js.flow`, `.d.ts`, and plain JS, enabling safe TypeScript interop with Flow-typed code. adopted in [StyleX](https://github.com/facebook/stylex), [Metro](https://github.com/facebook/metro), and React Native (powering RN 0.80's [Strict TypeScript API](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/06/12/moving-towards-a-stable-javascript-api))
- **Chromium & web standards** · represented Meta on the [W3C Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/groups/other/ac/). removed unload handlers from Facebook's tracking pixel, resolving what was at the time the #1 source of bfcache ineligibility across the web. collaborated with Chrome to identify and resolve [`content-visibility`](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/7384) issues found through adoption on Facebook. drove the [Service Worker Subresource Filter](https://chromestatus.com/feature/6015753541124096) from [spec proposal](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/1584) through [TAG review](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/630), [implementation](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-reviews/c/IDQHbQoBNbE), and [origin trial](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/GtR3POPyefM) on facebook.com — the problem has since been addressed by the [Static Routing API](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/service-worker-static-routing) in Chrome 123
- **[Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel)** · updated [Class Fields to Stage 3](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/6076), changed [template literals to default to spec mode](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/6098), and contributed to [babel-upgrade](https://github.com/babel/babel-upgrade/pulls?q=author%3Anoahlemen)

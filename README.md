# hi, i'm noah!

i'm a software engineer on the web platform team at [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb). before that i spent six and a half years at [Meta](https://github.com/facebook) on React and web infrastructure, with a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in between

## open source highlights

- **[React](https://github.com/facebook/react)** · former core team member. coordinated a company-wide deprecation of legacy APIs across thousands of callsites and helped unblock open-source React development. in the [open-source repo](https://github.com/facebook/react/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Anoahlemen+is%3Amerged): worked on the scheduler ([`scheduler.yield`](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/27069), [`postTask`](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/27295)), cleaned up deprecated APIs and feature flags, ran experiments on [Activity](https://react.dev/reference/react/Activity), and supported the [React 19](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pulls?q=reviewed-by%3Anoahlemen) release.

- **[flow-api-translator](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/tree/main/tools/hermes-parser/js/flow-api-translator)** · took this from prototype to production ([commits](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Afacebook%2Fhermes+%22noahlemen%40meta.com%22&type=commits)) with the Flow team. translates Flow source into `.d.ts` and plain JS for TypeScript interop with Flow-typed code. adopted in [StyleX](https://github.com/facebook/stylex), [Metro](https://github.com/facebook/metro), and React Native, where it powers [RN 0.80's strict TypeScript API](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2025/06/12/moving-towards-a-stable-javascript-api).

- **Chromium & web standards** · removed unload handlers from Facebook's tracking pixel, one of the most widely deployed scripts on the web, unblocking [bfcache](https://web.dev/articles/bfcache) eligibility for millions of pages. drove the [Service Worker Subresource Filter](https://chromestatus.com/feature/6015753541124096) from [spec proposal](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/1584) through implementation and origin trial on facebook.com; Chrome 123 later shipped the [Static Routing API](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/service-worker-static-routing) to solve this more broadly.
